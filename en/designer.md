Designer
====


CuteReport solution comes with a standalone designer which helps to manage CuteReport's templates. CuteDesigner itself has only few functions and provides API to support modules. Modules are used to provide and extend any current or further designer's functionality. Modules can provide (gui-modules) or do not provide (nongui-modules) user interface elements. Some of the basic gui modules are: ReportEditor, PageEditor, ScriptEditor, DatasetEditor, and Preview. Each module provides its own functionality and can be dependent of the other module(s). Also any module can be replaced by another with extended functionality.

Lets take a look at the some of these modules.
