ScriptEditor module
-----

You can switch to ScriptEditor by pressing the "Script" button on the module bar. Script editor is a pretty simple module and contains an editor with syntax highlighting and "Validate" button. Validation checks only the syntax correctness of your script and doesn't actually run the script. So even if your script passed validation, it still may contain runtime errors. Usually you can see all errors by pressing the green button on the left bottom of the Designer window. If there are errors in the script, the button becomes red. ScriptEditor uses javascript as scripting language.
