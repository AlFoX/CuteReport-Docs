Creating Report
===

In this chapter we will review some general aspects of report designing. We will take close on some items and theisr properties and will make some report examples. Make sure you have CuteReport installed and try to make these examples by yourself using preinstalled test databases. Since CuteReport is in active developing, some parts of this documentation can differ from your CuteReport installation.
