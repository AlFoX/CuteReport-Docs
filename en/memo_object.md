Memo object
----
The Memo object has many great features to draw text on a page. It can draw text in a frame and can be filled with some color. The text can be displayed using any font with any size and style. All the properties can be set using Property Editor ![TODO: or visually with the help of the toolbar]:

Here you can see some samples:

*First text line with some very useful info*

*Second line with some other useful info*
