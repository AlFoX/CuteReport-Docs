Now we will create our second report and will learn how to use datasets. For that we will use test sqlite database named "business.db".
By first create new epty report by pressing "main menu -> Report -> New Report". Go to the tab "Page" and create new page if not exists. There are some types of page possible. For now we will use "Standard Page" or "Extended page"(for commercial version). Click on combobox and select appropriate page type and then click on the button "Add new page" ![AddNewPageButton].
