DatasetEditor module
-----

You can switch to ScriptEditor by pressing the "Dataset" button on the module bar (#1). All created datasets of the current report are shown on the datasets bar (#2). Using this bar you can switch between datasets (mouse click) or rename the current dataset (mouse double-click). For creating a new dataset, press combobox #3 and choose the dataset type you want. Basic distribution provides 3 datasets: CSV dataset, SQL dataset and FileSystem Dataset. Each dataset is described below. To delete the current dataset, press button #3. There is no Undo function implemented yet, so be careful while deleting. When you have set all the options for the created dataset, you can press the "Test it" button (#5). All datasets have a common interface and provide data as a table. Each dataset has its own configuration widget (#6).
