"Hello World" report example
-----
This simple report example contains just one piece of information: "Hello World!" text. Open CuteReport Designer, go to "Page editor" using right tab panel. Since any item can be placed only on carrier band, we must place any band first. Click on the button "Bands" ![BandsGroupIcon] and select any simple band for example PageHeader. Click somewhere on page to place this band (page have to be created before). Then click on button with the title "Items" or icon ![ItemsGroupIcon] and select "Memo" ![MemoIcon]. There is also Memo (Extended) exists in the commercial version, that extends functionality of the Memo. Use any of them if you have both. After selecting Memo item, click somewhere inside PageHeader to place selected Memo. The object will be placed in mouse position. 

![MemoItemOnPage]

Depending of your local settings Memo Helper dialog will appear immediately or you can make double-click on the Memo to show this dialog. Type "Hello World!" and then click "Ok" button.

![MemoItemHelper1]

Designer will be switched to "Preview" tab and renderer report page with "Hello World!" will appear. Rendered repport can be printed or exported to the one of the supported export formats.
